# Image formats (unless otherwise specified):
# -------------------------------------------
#
#  - RGB images are stored as a np.ndarray with dimensions (3, width, height).
#    The first component is red, the second green, and the third blue.
#    They are floats within [0, 1] and type IMGTYPE = np.float32 or np.float64.
#
#  - HSV images are stored as a np.ndarray with dimensions (width, height, 3).
#    The first component is the hue, the second the saturation, and the third the value.
#    They are floats within [0, 1] and type IMGTYPE = np.float32 or np.float64.

# Data type used for images (either np.float32 or np.float64).
